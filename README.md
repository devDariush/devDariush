# Hi there 👋
This is Dariush – your friendly neighborhood bug whisperer and occasional compiler therapist.  
When I’m not convincing code to run, I’m usually convincing myself that coffee counts as a meal.

## 🧑‍💻 About Me
- 🎓 **Computer Science B.Sc. student @ HHU Düsseldorf**
- 💡 **Interests:** Privacy Tech, Automation, Networking, Low-Level/OS, Backend Development, Mixed Reality, AI  
- 🛠 **Current Tools:** Java, Docker, Bash, Python, a sprinkle of JavaScript when absolutely necessary  
- 🧠 **Currently focusing on:** Building little side projects to reward my dopamine-addicted brain and deploying them on some free VPS that are completely maxed-out  
- 🎯 **Goal:** Building *very* broad knowledge, testing out many languages and libraries/frameworks, and eventually deciding what to specialize in

## 🌟 Starred Repos I Like
These aren’t mine (yet), but they’re too good not to share:  
- [**All-jellyfin-media-server**](https://github.com/Morzomb/All-jellyfin-media-server) – I never pay for Netflix again (just kidding, I keep it *totally* legal!)
- [**libmonero**](https://github.com/monerobuilders/libmonero) – Modern, easy-to-understand, fast Monero library
- [**monero-suite**](https://github.com/hundehausen/monero-suite) – This tool generates a Docker Compose file for everything Monero-related
- [**fastapi**](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) – My current favorite Python backend framework

## 🧪 TIL (Today I Learned)
- NAT tables can be overwhelmed just by a flood of UDP mappings.  
- You can run a surprisingly heavy stack on a €0/month VPS, right before it melts.  
- The most dangerous bug is the one you *thought* you fixed.

## 🛠 Dev Environment
- **OS**: Arch (when I’m serious), macOS (when I’m lazy), soon: NixOS  
- **Editor**: VS Code + Neovim  
- **Terminal**: fish shell because `ls` deserves color  
- **Dotfiles**: A chaotic mix that somehow works
